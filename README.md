# ðŸ’¸ Fraud Detection Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent activities across two distinct datasets: a synthetic "Fraud Data" dataset and a real-world "Credit Card Fraud" dataset. The pipeline covers all stages from raw data ingestion to model training and evaluation, with a focus on handling highly imbalanced datasets.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Data Ingestion:** Loads raw data from CSV files.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw data, handles missing values, and merges supplementary data (IP addresses to countries).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creates new informative features from existing data points to enhance model performance.
* **Model Training:** Trains machine learning models (Random Forest for Fraud Data, Logistic Regression for Credit Card Data) with strategies like SMOTE to address class imbalance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using key metrics suitable for imbalanced classification (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC) and visualizes results with Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves, and Precision-Recall Curves.
